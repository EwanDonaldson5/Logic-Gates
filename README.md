# Logic-Gates
A website created to educate and test people on how to use logic gates.
This basic web site was a small assignment set during my university course. This was completed during my first year of university. 
Therefore this is only a very basic demonstration of the work I can do in web development.

This was assigned to demonstrate our understanding of our web development using HTML, CSS, Javscript. To demonstrate this I created 
pages that allowed users to educate and test themselves on how to use logic gates. These pages are connected together via a 
navigation bar that is consitent across all pages.

To gain a better understanding of the work I can achieve please look to another one of my repositories, listed as my dissertation.
